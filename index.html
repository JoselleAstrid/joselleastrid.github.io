<h1>PROJECTS</h1>

<p>Here's a list of coding projects, research summaries, and other resources that I've created or co-created.</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/joselleastrid/ram-watch-cheat-engine">RAM watch scripts in Cheat Engine</a></dt>
  <dd>Mostly for Gamecube/Wii games running in Dolphin emulator. This includes the Lua scripts that I use to look into GX and Galaxy's mechanics.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/joselleastrid/game-notes">Game notes</a></dt>
  <dd>Notes on various games that I wanted to share which didn't fit anywhere else.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>F-Zero GX</h2>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/joselleastrid/fzerogx-docs/">fzerogx-docs on GitHub</a></dt>
  <dd>Topics include <a href="https://github.com/joselleastrid/fzerogx-docs/blob/master/checkpoints/index.md">checkpoints</a> and <a href="https://github.com/joselleastrid/fzerogx-docs/blob/master/flying/index.md">spaceflying</a>, <a href="https://github.com/joselleastrid/fzerogx-docs/blob/master/mechanics/cpus.md">CPU rubberbanding</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/joselleastrid/fzerogx-docs/blob/master/file_formats/gci_replay.md">replay file format</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/joselleastrid/fzerogx-docs/blob/master/addresses/index.md">known memory addresses</a>. I may merge some of the below resources into this repository, but haven't done so at this time of writing.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17DqpOEgzh0RqSKZ-5q5kanhI3uRhQ6w0xo4GTJO5cQI/edit">Machines vs. Staff Ghosts spreadsheet</a></dt>
  <dd>The best known times on each track with each non-custom machine. Shows how many machines can beat each staff ghost. The color indicators and ranking tabs work using Javascript. Coded by me, updated by various people. The original idea was based on an F-Zero X competition spreadsheet by darkeye.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133Xsq-KV3lpfk9SS4_L84WV-JuXHOR8_GlFZRnskkSU/edit?usp=sharing">Machines' internal stats</a></dt>
  <dd>The internal stats of non-custom machines and custom parts. "Body, boost, and grip" doesn't come close to the whole story; there are over 20 different stats! This stat research contributed to the development of game mods such as GX Unleashed and GXtreme.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgIrJ5ojB6s">Spaceflying live demo</a></dt>
  <dd>Done for an FZC marathon. Not very well prepared, but it's the only video explanation I have on checkpoints so far.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vHPonGtakoysZdGkSDOoVt0_xSpdYKCRnmqzhdLBfzA/edit?usp=sharing">Checkpoint stats dump spreadsheet</a></dt>
  <dd>Stats I used to generate checkpoint maps. Values are not exact; obtained using RAM watch while driving slowly around the course.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/joselleastrid/fzgx-checkpoint-diagrams/">Checkpoint diagram tool</a></dt>
  <dd>Program used to generate checkpoint maps. A little rough, and the checkpoint data might not be up to date with the spreadsheet, but try it if you're interested.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c4a7d6xZ-rnK-E5p7d__6V1qhLxcdOHwAmv-FR8K50s/edit?usp=sharing">Emblem file format</a></dt>
  <dd>Based on work by GCMM devs and Ralf. The checksum description in particular is from their work.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/fzerocentral/fzgx-image2emblem">Image-to-emblem converter tool</a></dt>
  <dd>Take an image file and convert it into a GX emblem .gci file, so that you don't need to draw dot by dot using GX's emblem editor. The Python version was primarily coded by me.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lhPvUVT9MO0J5U-bF9S9y3okGtPYD7UGvXNMCctJ3-4/edit?usp=sharing">Controller calibration</a></dt>
  <dd>How GX's controller calibration works. The calibration on a fresh savefile is different from the default calibration shown when you enter the calibration menu.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://tcrf.net/F-Zero_GX/Regional_Differences#Exclusive_Custom_Parts">Special custom parts</a></dt>
  <dd>The 15 custom-machine parts that everyone uses cheats to get nowadays. Most of them were only available for a limited time at events and kiosks in Japan. Info is from the official GX/AX website.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://ln.sync.com/dl/2159e3d90#b8gau38r-4eixypk7-xtbuizk7-gjau7752">Some uploaded replay files</a></dt>
  <dd>Extracted using Wii Homebrew and GCMM. You can load these files on your Wii or on Dolphin to play them.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 </h2>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyMlBXKUxH72PK-ty1Du7JxxOnUcUM74u">Mechanics videos</a></dt>
  <dd>Topics include differing height of Wiimote and Nunchuk spins, residual tilt affecting jump height in SMG1, and timing properties of notification boxes after finishing a level.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Se76mcQjJtO-A5aCscW1z2SmeheoMkDxnoeNxnxZQNc/edit?usp=sharing">Speed, distance, and timing info</a></dt>
  <dd>A summary of speed/distance/timing numbers, including ones not covered in any videos yet. Also has links to in-depth documents, covering topics like run speed and acceleration, Yoshi flutter speed, and midair rock spins.</dd>

  <dt><a href="http://speedruntools.com/routing/smgalaxy/">SMG1 Language comparison tool for speedruns</a></dt>
  <dd>Compares the text speed of Korean, Japanese, English, and other languages. This tool compares the text over an entire speedrun, and can also be used to check basic dependencies in speedrun routes (such as stars required to unlock a galaxy). At this time of writing, I haven't actually explained how text speed works in this game, but this tool provides some clues by showing the calculations used.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/178cRnPLYlJc5nNz8FpLbkVuMuIQFC-U2RGZ665Lk5WY/edit">SMG1 Load time tests</a></dt>
  <dd>How game load times are affected by the disc used and the disc loader software used.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Other Games</h2>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://i.imgur.com/PegvcxN.png">New Super Marisa Land - Map showing all exits</a></dt>
  <dd>This is one of those games where I played around with strategies and routing, but barely got around to doing any runs. However, I did a 100% race once, and made this map as a reference of what 100% completion looks like. Like in Super Mario World, some level exits are useless but still form a path on the map.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mZ7jBAfALq6dMAAnFUwUaGEs0Ow6Tp3TcwxB7ZGapxQ/edit?usp=sharing">Sonic Adventure 2 - Emerald/key hint guide</a></dt>
  <dd>SadisticMystic compiled the in-game hint text back in the 2000s, and I ported it to spreadsheet form and added some descriptions. I've since given permission to other SA2 runners to update the sheet as they see fit.</dd>
